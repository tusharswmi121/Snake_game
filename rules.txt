-----------------------Snake Game Rules and Instructions--------------------

1. Objective:
    a. Control the snake to eat food and increase your score.
    b. Avoid collisions with the walls or yourself to stay in the game.

2. Controls:
    a. Move Left: Press a
    b. Move Right: Press d
    c. Move Up: Press w
    d. Move Down: Press s
    e. Quit Game: Press q (immediately stops the game)

3. Gameplay:
    a. The snake starts at the center of the game board.
    b. The snake moves continuously in the direction you last pressed.
    c. The goal is to eat the food (denoted by F on the screen). Each time the snake eats food:
    d. The score increases by 1.
    e. The snake's length increases by one segment.
    f. A new piece of food appears at a random location.

4. Collision and Lives:
    a. Wall Collisions:
    The game board is wrapped around. If the snake moves beyond one edge, it appears on
    the opposite edge. However, each collision with the wall decreases the number of 
    lives.

    b. Self-Collisions:
    If the snake runs into itself, it loses a life. The game will reset the snake's 
    position and state but will immediately exit if the number of lives reaches zero.

    c. Game Over:
    The game ends if the number of lives reaches zero due to wall collisions or self-collisions.
    When the game ends, the final score is displayed, and the game exits.

5. Visuals:
    a. The snake is represented by O for the head and o for the body segments.
    b. The food is represented by F.
    c. The boundaries of the game board are marked with #
